        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This is a specific formula for achieving a perfectly pink prime rib cooked somewhere a shade under medium rare. To use this method you must have a full-sized, modern oven with a digital temperature setting that indicates when it is preheated. Older ovens with manual controls can vary greatly, and the doors may not have the proper insulation.

            <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
